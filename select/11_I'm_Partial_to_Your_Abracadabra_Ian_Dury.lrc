[00:09.03] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[00:12.73] I'm raptured by the joy of it all
[00:16.38] So stop me where you start
[00:18.25] The cockles of his heart
[00:20.95] The panties sends it right up the wall
[00:39.95] 
[00:25.47] Please, please, stop it, it likes it
[00:26.42] Tickles it to death either way
[00:30.01] These lovely boots exist
[00:35.41] To drive it round the twist
[00:37.24] The call of nature must be obeyed
[00:53.74] 
[00:40.86] Glad it's over, but this is worse
[00:44.52] Could hardly say it had been coerced
[00:53.52] Stop it cos it likes it, it's worse
[01:11.02] 
[00:56.23] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[01:00.71] The unforeseen erogenous zones
[01:04.47] Stop, it insists
[01:08.02] Slap it with your wrists
[01:10.73] It likes it when you leave it alone
[01:28.23] 
[01:13.43] There's been a manifestation
[01:34.28] Nature made it answer the call
[01:38.75] It simply can't resist
[01:41.49] Boots and pants like this
[01:44.24] Abracadabra for all
[01:53.74] 
[01:46.99] Glad that's over, but this is worse
[01:52.37] Roll it over, too perverse
[01:59.68] Stop it cos it likes it, it's worse
[02:17.18] 
[02:04.18] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:07.70] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:16.83] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:23.27] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:26.86] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:33.27] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:39.61] I'm partial to your abracadabra
[02:43.24] I'm partial to your abracadabra
