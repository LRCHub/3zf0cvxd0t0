Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of
the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said
by a lady in red
You hear the last few words
of your life
With a haunting glance,
now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell
on the night
Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said,
"Death or love tonight"
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet,
the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Choose the road on the west side
As the dust flies, watch it burn
Don't waste time on a feeling
Your depression won't return
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of
the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said
by a lady in red
You hear the last few words
of your life
With a haunting glance,
now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell
on the night
Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said,
"Death or love tonight"
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet,
the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Phantom of the dance floor,
come to me
Sing for me a sinful melody
Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said,
"Death or love tonight"
